# From 4 Hours to 8 Minutes with AI Agents That Transform SRE Incident Response 

This repo contains the setup and files for the demo. The talk description and slides are [here](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon25emea/presentation/jausovec).


## Demo setup

The demo creates a kind (local) cluster; however, you could deploy this on any other Kubernetes cluster as well. To create a cluster and deploy everything, run: 

```sh
./setup.sh
```

Once everything is installed, you can open kagent UI on `localhost:8001`.
